 THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MENS SOULS.
 THE SUMMER SOLDIER AND THE SUNSHINE PATRIOT WILL IN THIS CRISIS,
 SHRINK FROM THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY.  BUT HE THAT STANDS NOW,
 DESERVES THE LOVE AND THANKS OF MAN AND WOMAN.
 TYRANNY, LIKE HELL, IS NOT EASILY CONQUERED,
 YET WE HAVE THIS CONSOLATION WITH US,
 THAT THE HARDER THE CONFLICT, THE MORE GLORIOUS THE TRIUMPH.
 WHAT WE OBTAIN TOO CHEAP, WE ESTEEM TOO LIGHTLY, 
 'TIS DEARNESS ONLY THAT GIVES EVERYTHING ITS VALUE.
