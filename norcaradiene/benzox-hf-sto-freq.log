 LET US LEARN TO DREAM, GENTLEMEN, THEN PERHAPS WE SHALL
 DISCOVER THE TRUTH;  BUT LET US BEWARE OF PUBLISHING
 OUR DREAMS ABROAD BEFORE THEY HAVE BEEN SCRUTINIZED
 BY OUR VIGILANT INTELLECT ... LET US ALWAYS ALLOW
 THE FRUIT TO HANG UNTIL IT IS RIPE.  UNRIPE FRUIT
 BRINGS EVEN THE GROWER BUT LITTLE PROFIT; IT DAMAGES
 THE HEALTH OF THOSE WHO CONSUME IT; IT ENDANGERS
 PARTICULARLY THE YOUTH WHO CANNOT YET DISTINGUISH
 BETWEEN RIPE AND UNRIPE FRUIT.
