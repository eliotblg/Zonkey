#TODO
- get frontier treatment done
  - add capping H atoms
  - split force of that atoms on the "explicit" ones
  - delete charge scheme
  - shift charges scheme
  - shift charges with dipole scheme
- have QM extra and MMextra set up properly as list not string
- have more printing of each modules (at least at the begining)
- warp things up as a proper package
- add option for job type (sp, gradient, opt)
- have output for gradients too
- have an MD module (through NAMD or write one)
- separate pdb and coordinates files for MM (read pdb for structure in namd but coords fom xyz) 
- change the printing in opt to just have important values for convergence


#DONE
- remove any trace of the zk- coordinate pdb?
- output also an .xyz with double coordinates
